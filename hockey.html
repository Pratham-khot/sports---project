    <p><b><u>Rules of Hockey</u></b></p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>In a field hockey match, two teams with 11 players each, use specially designed sticks to play for an hour and score
        goals to win a contest.</li>
        <li>Players can only hit the ball with the flat side of their stick. Other than the goalkeeper, players can't control the
        ball with their feet or any other part of their body.</li>
        <li>Players use the flat side of their stick to hit and dribble the ball down the field. The goal is to shoot the ball past
        the goalkeeper and into the opponent's goal cage. Players can't kick, hold, or carry the ball. A game consists of two
        30-minute halves. Players must wear proper attire, including shin guards and mouth guards.</li>
