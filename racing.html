    <p><b><u>Rules of Formula Racing</u></b></p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>The top 10 finishers in each Grand Prix receive points, with the winner receiving 25 points. The points scale down to 18
        points for second place, 15 for third, and so on.</li>
        <li>The driver who sets the fastest lap in a Grand Prix receives an additional point, but only if they finish in the top 10.</li>
        <li>Drivers who finish in 11th place or lower do not receive points.</li>
        <li>Drivers and teams can also earn an extra point if a driver in the top 10 sets the fastest lap of the race. However, if a
        driver outside the top 10 sets the fastest lap, they won't receive the bonus point.</li>
